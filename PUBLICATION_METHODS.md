# RLE Control System Architecture

## Methods: Implementation Overview

Our RLE-based control system consists of three modular components operating in the measurement→prediction→prevention paradigm.

### Module 1: Real-Time Monitoring
**Purpose**: Continuous hardware telemetry for energy flow measurement

**Components**:
- GPU metrics: NVML-based power, temperature, utilization, fan speed
- CPU metrics: psutil-based utilization, estimated power (with optional HWiNFO integration for full sensor coverage)
- Frequency tracking: CPU clock cycles per joule for computational efficiency analysis

**Output**: CSV logs with 1 Hz resolution containing all efficiency components (RLE_raw, RLE_smoothed, E_th, E_pw, rolling_peak)

### Module 2: Predictive Analysis
**Purpose**: Forecast thermal collapse before onset

**Algorithm**:
- Collapse detection: Rolling variance analysis with 7-second hysteresis
- Threshold logic: RLE drops below 65% of rolling peak sustained for ≥7 seconds
- Evidence requirement: Thermal (temp > limit-5°C) OR power-capped (load > 0.95)
- Spectral analysis: FFT-based thermal cycle detection

**Output**: Binary collapse flags + early warning indicators

### Module 3: Feed-Forward Control
**Purpose**: Prevent instability through adaptive workload management

**Control Law**:
```
if RLE < 0.3 (critical):
    reduce_cpu_priority()
    throttle_frequency()
elif RLE < 0.5 (warning):
    log_warning()
    monitor_closely()
```

**Dynamic Scaling**: Environmental compensation
- Formula: `P_target = P_base × (1 - 0.02 × ΔT_ambient)`
- Adjusts power targets based on ambient temperature (≈2% per °C)

**Adaptive Control**: Power level targeting
- Regression model: `Power(W) = 1.25 × Util(%) + 0.0007` (R² = 1.0)
- Dynamically adjusts utilization to hit specific power targets

### Performance Characteristics

**Overhead**: <1% CPU usage during monitoring
**Latency**: 5-second control loop
**Memory**: <100 MB for 8-hour sessions
**Scalability**: Multi-device support (CPU + GPU + extensible)

**Validation**: Control system tested on 30-minute sustained 100% load stress tests with collapse prediction accuracy measured against observed thermal events.
