# Manual Data Entry for 3DMark Wild Life Extreme

Since I can't view screenshots directly, please provide the data from your 14 screenshots.

## What I Need

For each screenshot, give me:

1. **Time** (how many minutes/seconds into the test)
2. **Temperature** (in Celsius)
3. **Frame Rate** (FPS)

Example:
```
3:40 PM (start) - Temp: 32°C, FPS: 50
3:45 PM (5 min) - Temp: 36°C, FPS: 48
3:50 PM (10 min) - Temp: 40°C, FPS: 42
...
4:13 PM (33 min) - Temp: 45°C, FPS: 38
```

## Quick Format

Just paste something like:
```
Time    Temp (°C)    FPS
0:00    32          50
5:00    36          48
10:00   40          42
15:00   43          39
20:00   45          37
```

OR just tell me:
- **Start temp/FPS**
- **End temp/FPS**
- Any interesting points in between (thermal throttling, etc.)

I'll interpolate the rest.
