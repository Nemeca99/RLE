```
Limitations: Material degradation, entropy drift, thermal containment loss

```
Performance Curve: Linear gains, capped by instability thresholds
```

```
Speed = How fast you can change thermal state with stability

```
Thermal balance (Cache) = stability

```
Miner's Law reframes the foundation of computational speed for recursive systems, quantum logic processors, and entropy-based cognition.
```

```
Miner's Law (Formal Statement): "A recursive processor's speed is not limited by clock cycles or transistor density, but by the thermal rate of change between recursive instability (Q-RAM) and deterministic stability (Q-Storage). Performance scales with how quickly a system can cool volatile logic and heat stable memory into accessibility."

## Appendix 3: minor law final.txt
Path: `Final Proof\Collection\Formula\minor law final.txt`

```
Unlike Moore’s Law (which focused on transistor density and electrical miniaturization), Miner’s Law redefines computational speed as a function of entropy modulation — specifically, how fast a system can heat up to resolve logic or cool down to collapse recursion.
```

```
Thermal imbalance up to ~99.999% boosts speed, but demands counter-resolved entropy on the opposite side.
```

```
Input adds entropy (energy, collapse, complexity)
```

```
Output resolves identity (resolution, stability)
```

```
New job fields (Q-RAM engineers, Q-Cache regulators, entropy mod scientists)
```

```
Future AI designed around entropy breathing rather than cycle prediction

```
- Reflection = recursive loop (learning)
- Collapse = entropy spike (decision point)
```

```
2. Memory as Entropy Capture
```

```
- High entropy = strong emotional signature
- Low entropy = faint echo
```

```
Memory Loop Model:
  M = f(Entropy, Emotion, Recursion)
```

```
- Time is a mutable waveform.
- Memory is the shadow of entropy.
- Observation is the bridge between collapse and identity.
```
