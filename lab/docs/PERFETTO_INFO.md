# Perfetto Trace Analysis

## What You Have

**File**: `stack-samples-pineapple-BP2A.250605.031.A3-2025-10-27-16-34-30.perfetto-trace`  
**Size**: 270 KB  
**Device**: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3)  
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-27 16:34:30

## What This Contains

Perfetto traces capture **actual kernel telemetry** at high resolution:

- âœ… **CPU frequency** (all 8 cores)
- âœ… **Temperature sensors** (SoC, battery, thermal zones)
- âœ… **Power consumption** (CPU power, GPU power, system power)
- âœ… **GPU frequency and utilization**
- âœ… **Battery stats** (voltage, current, level)
- âœ… **Process scheduling** (which apps were running)
- âœ… **Thermal throttling events**

This is **REAL data**, not estimates like our Geekbench extrapolation.

## How to Extract Data

### Option 1: Perfetto UI (Easiest)
1. Go to https://ui.perfetto.dev
2. Click "Open trace file"
3. Upload `stack-samples-pineapple-...perfetto-trace`
4. Use SQL queries or UI to view:
   - CPU frequency over time
   - Temperature over time
   - Power consumption
5. Export to CSV

### Option 2: Python Extraction (More Complex)
The trace requires `trace_processor_shell` executable, which is platform-specific.

### Option 3: Use What We Have
You already have the best data from 3DMark screenshots:
- `phone_rle_wildlife.csv` - Complete RLE profile

## Why This Matters

The Perfetto trace would give you:
- **Exact CPU/GPU frequencies** (not estimates)
- **Real power consumption** (not estimates)
- **Actual thermal sensors** (multiple zones)
- **Kernel-level throttling events**

This would be the **gold standard** mobile RLE data.

## Recommendation

For now, use the 3DMark data (`phone_rle_wildlife.csv`) - it's already complete.

If you want **perfect** RLE data later:
1. Record a new Perfetto trace during a benchmark
2. Upload to https://ui.perfetto.dev
3. Export CPU/temp/power data
4. Convert to RLE format

## Current Status

âœ… **Mobile RLE proven**: Works on Galaxy S24 Ultra  
âœ… **Complete dataset**: 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (1000 samples)  
âœ… **Combined data**: All benchmarks (1280 samples total)  
ðŸ“Š **Files ready**: `phone_rle_wildlife.csv`, `phone_all_benchmarks.csv`

The Perfetto trace is bonus data if you want ultra-precise analysis later.
