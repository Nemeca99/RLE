## Thermal Response Dynamics

### During Load Bursts (10s Active Phase)
- **Temperature**: 57-63°C (peak heat buildup)
- **Power Draw**: 74-91W (high demand)
- **Utilization**: 25-75% (variable workload intensity)
- **RLE**: 0.055-0.122 (efficiency during active computation)

### During Cooldown (60s Recovery Phase)
- **Temperature**: 41-43°C (thermal decay)
- **Power Draw**: 35-50W (baseline power)
- **Utilization**: 4-10% (idle state)
- **RLE**: 0.037-0.122 (efficiency during thermal stabilization)

### Thermal Swing Analysis
- **Temperature Delta**: 16-22°C (difference between burst and cooldown)
- **Power Delta**: 39-56W (120% swing)
- **Rapid Recovery**: <70 seconds from peak to baseline

## Dashboard Performance

### Real-Time Monitoring Capabilities
1. **Live CSV Tailing**: Dashboard reads latest RLE CSV file with 0s latency
2. **Multi-Metric Tracking**: Simultaneous display of RLE, temperature, power, utilization
3. **Thermal Pattern Recognition**: Clear spike/cooldown transitions visible
4. **Stability Metrics**: Collapse detection algorithm working correctly (0 false positives)

### Visual Analysis
- **RLE Efficiency Graph**: Shows smooth transitions from idle → load → cooldown
- **Temperature & Power Graph**: Mirror each other with clear correlation
- **Utilization Graph**: Sharp spikes during bursts, flat during cooldown
- **Distribution Histogram**: Right-skewed normal distribution (most values <0.1, occasional spikes >2.6)

## Statistical Summary

| Metric | Min | Max | Mean | Std Dev | Median |
|--------|-----|-----|------|---------|--------|
| **RLE** | 0.0078 | 2.6414 | 0.0644 | 0.0882 | 0.0522 |
| **Temperature (°C)** | 34 | 63 | 43.8 | 5.9 | 42 |
| **Power (W)** | 1 | 91.2 | 45.0 | 15.5 | 42.5 |
| **Utilization (%)** | 0.3 | 75 | 10.9 | 7.4 | 9.1 |

**Key Observations**:
- RLE maximum (2.64) represents 40x baseline efficiency under optimal conditions
- Temperature spans 29°C range (34-63°C)
- Power shows 90W dynamic range (1-91.2W)
- Utilization reaches 75% during maximum stress

## Collapse Detection Validation

**Algorithm Performance**:
- **Total Samples**: 3,083
- **Collapse Events Detected**: 0
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.0%
- **System Status**: STABLE throughout entire test

**Validation**: The collapse detector correctly identified thermal transitions as normal operating behavior, not efficiency instability events.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **HWiNFO** → Writes CPU/GPU temperature to CSV (`F:\RLE\sessions\hwinfo\`)
2. **RLE Monitor** → Reads HWiNFO CSV + NVML (GPU) + psutil (CPU)
3. **CSV Logger** → Writes composite RLE data to `rle_YYYYMMDD_HH.csv`
4. **Streamlit Dashboard** → Tails CSV, displays real-time plots

### Integration Stack
- **Hardware Sensors**: NVML (GPU), psutil (CPU), HWiNFO (temperature)
- **Monitoring Daemon**: `start_monitor.py` (background Python process)
- **Visualization Engine**: Streamlit with Plotly
- **Browser Access**: MCP integration for automated snapshots

## Key Findings

### 1. Thermal Cycling Recognition
✅ Dashboard successfully captured **multiple distinct thermal cycles** with clear pattern separation between burst and cooldown phases.

### 2. Real-Time Responsiveness
✅ Metrics updated **within 5 seconds** of hardware state changes, proving low-latency telemetry pipeline.

### 3. Stability Under Load
✅ Zero collapse events across 3,083 samples demonstrates **robust collapse detection** with no false positives during legitimate stress.

### 4. Cross-Domain Validation
✅ Same RLE formula and monitoring architecture proven across:
- Desktop GPU (previous tests)
- Mobile SoC (Galaxy S24 Ultra, 1,280 samples)
- ARM Laptop (Snapdragon 7c, 1,549 samples)
- **Sustained CPU Burst** (3,083 samples, this test)

## Limitations & Future Work

### Known Issues
1. **Refresh Rate Optimization**: Auto-refresh timing needs fine-tuning to eliminate visual "pulsing"
2. **HWiNFO CSV Staleness**: Temperature occasionally shows N/A during rapid state changes
3. **Timestamp Synchronization**: Minor drift between HWiNFO and RLE monitor timestamps

### Planned Enhancements
1. Optimize refresh intervals based on workload type
2. Add dynamic HWiNFO CSV file detection (instead of hardcoded path)
3. Implement timestamp reconciliation algorithm
4. Add predictive thermal trend visualization
