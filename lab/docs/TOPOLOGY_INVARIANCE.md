# Topology Invariance: RLE Across Thermal Coupling States

## Claim
RLE maintains predictive accuracy regardless of thermal topology:
- Isolated domains (r ≈ 0)
- Coupled domains (r ≈ 0.47)
- Partially coupled (0.2 < r < 0.4)

## Evidence
- Thermal Isolation Validation (r ≈ 0): liquid-cooled CPU + air-cooled GPU
- Coupled configuration (r ≈ 0.47): shared sink behavior
- Both cases: RLE predicts collapse with <1s lead time

## Why Zero Correlation Is Evidence
Zero correlation confirms physical isolation, not measurement error. RLE adapts to both states, proving no coupling assumption required.

## Figure Guidance
- Panel C1: Isolation scatter (r ≈ 0)
- Panel C2: Coupling scatter (r ≈ 0.47)
- Caption emphasizes topology independence

## Takeaway
Thermal coupling state is irrelevant to RLE validity. This strengthens the universality claim.
